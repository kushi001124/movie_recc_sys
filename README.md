The system uses cosine similarity algorithms to match user preferences with movie characteristics, providing accurate and relevant recommendations.

Features:

Content-Based Filtering: Analyzes movie features to generate recommendations

Cosine Similarity Algorithm: Computes similarity between movies based on feature vectors

Interactive Web Interface: Built with Streamlit for real-time user interaction

Feature Extraction: Processes movie metadata including genres, cast, crew, and keywords

Text Vectorization: Converts movie descriptions into numerical vectors for similarity computation

Real-time Recommendations: Instant movie suggestions based on user input
